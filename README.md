based on php for beginners course from laracasts youtube channel,
i started this simple project to improve my skills in pure php,
and some tecnical stuff about php web frameworks using simple code aproaches.

Then i decided to upgrade the project to "another level", implementing something like modular architecture(like the angular way), just to help scaling the code.

the main branch contains the version near to the original laracasts course and
the modular-arch branch, containts the version with the upgrade i have made.
